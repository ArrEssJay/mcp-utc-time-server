# MCP UTC Time Server

## Overview
The MCP UTC Time Server is a Rust-based application that implements the MCP protocol to provide clients with access to the current UTC time. This server is designed to be easily installable and configurable within a development environment.

## Features
- Implements the MCP protocol for time requests.
- Provides the current UTC time in a standardized format.
- Modular architecture for easy maintenance and extension.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mcp-utc-time-server
   ```

2. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. If not, you can install them from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

3. Build the project:
   ```
   cargo build
   ```

4. Run the server:
   ```
   cargo run
   ```

## Usage
Once the server is running, clients can send requests to retrieve the current UTC time using the MCP protocol. The server will respond with the time formatted according to the protocol specifications.
